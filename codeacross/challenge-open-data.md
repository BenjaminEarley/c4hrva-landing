# Open Data

## What Is It?

* Work with your local officials to create an open data policy, or draft an implementation plan or accountability structure for a recently passed policy.
* Contribute to the [US City Open Data Census](http://us-city.census.okfn.org/)

### Do an Inventory: Where Does My City Stand on Open Data?

The first step in making data actionable is to make sure the data is easily accessible. Many cities, whether they have an open data policy in place or not, have work to do in terms of making key datasets open and available in machine-readable formats. Do an evaluation of where your city stands on releasing key datasets and work with your municipal partners to come up with a plan for making all of them open and available in 2014.

We have an [open data portal](https://communities.socrata.com/catalog/code-for-hampton-roads/)! All of these datasets should be published there.

[OpenPrism](http://openprism.thomaslevine.com/) is a tool that aggregates many of the open data portals datasets out there, you can use it to compare your city’s datasets to other cities, as well as to see what data other cities provide that your city doesn’t. 

In some cases, the city is not the entity responsible for a dataset (for example, in Tulsa there is an independent authority responsible for the transit system). That’s ok, we still want to know if and where those datasets are published. Be sure to note if it’s a non-city entity publishing the data.

If your city publishes all this data in machine-readable formats, give each other a round of high-fives! Then design/prototype an app or integration that would make this data useful for citizens.
